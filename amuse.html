        <h2><em>Super</em> Funny Adult Humor</h2>
        <p>The Basement Yard is a podcast, but I think watching their videos and seeing their facial expressions makes the experience of watching them more funny. </p>

        <h2>Make Your Day Brighter</h2>
        <p>This site is similar to The Onion. It has a lot of funny articles to read, but the big difference is that it also has Trivia & Jokes, Movies & TV, Science & History, and Videos. </p>
