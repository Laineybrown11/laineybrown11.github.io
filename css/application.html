            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Neon War is an online shooting game where your main aim is to shoot at the neon shapes. They will pop out from black holes. Aim at them by steering your cannon. You can only navigate it horizontally. Make sure that when it shoots, the bullets get in contact with the blocks. It is the only way to remove them in one of the most enjoyable arcade games!</p>

                <li>You will get blue hexagons when you destroy the objects on the platform. These hexagons will enable you to upgrade your cannon’s features. Upgrades will help you get the highest game scores by strengthening your gun. Each upgrade will bring it +5% power.

                        <p><strong>Gold Battery</strong>
                            A gold battery icon is at the upper left corner of the screen. It indicates your gun’s health. Any touch with objects will cause this health bar to drop. So, you must avoid getting in contact with the blocks as much as possible. They will keep bouncing along the platform until you eliminate them. Precise aiming will help you a lot.</p>
